## UsingSet.scala
Scala favors immutable collections. Mutable connections are available, if you want to mutable collection and are working in a single thread. Immutable collections are thread safe and side effect free which helps program correctness.  In this example we start with a set with 3 colors and then add another color. It does not modify the original Set but returns a new Set.
