# Programming Scala

## Chapter 2
In this chapter we install Scala and configure our enviroment to run Scala. We execute some code from the command line. Then we learn how to execute Scala code from a file and as a script. We then finally learn how to run it from an IDE and compile it with the "scalac" compiler".
