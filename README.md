Examples and cliff notes from my reading of Programming Scala. Programming Scala is a book to ramp up the Java Developer into the concepts of Scala to be able to hit the ground running.

## Chapter 2
In this chapter we install Scala and configure our enviroment to run Scala. We execute some code from the command line. Then we learn how to execute Scala code from a file and as a script. We then finally learn how to run it from an IDE and compile it with the "scalac" compiler".

In this chapter we compare Java to Scala with some code. We will compare the conciseness of scala.
