# Chapter 2
In this chapter we install Scala and configure our enviroment to run Scala. We execute some code from the command line. Then we learn how to execute Scala code from a file and as a script. We then finally learn how to run it from an IDE and compile it with the "scalac" compiler".

## HelloWorld.scala
In this example of Hello World, we write into a scala file and then execute it from the commandline as a script

## Script.scala
On Unix-like systems, Scala can be ran as scripts by setting the shell preamble. Reminder to give the script executable permissions with chmod +x.

## Sample.scala
We create a Scala class as main and use the Scala compile to compile the class and run it. Scala does not support static methods. With Scala we define an Object which is a Singleton class and initialize a main method within the object.
