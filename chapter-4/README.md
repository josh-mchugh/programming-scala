## Car.java
In this example of a Java class, it follows the the bean convention of exposing its properties. It has two properties, and corresponding getter methods. It also has a method to manipulate the miles property. It also has a constructor which intitializes the final field year.

## Car.scala
In Java we explicity defined the field and method for the property year and wrote an explicit constructor. Scala, the parameter took care of defining that field and writing the accessor method. Scala accomplishes the same thing wih more concise code.
